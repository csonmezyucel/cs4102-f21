<a name="introduction"></a>Quiz Results / Curves / Pass Thresholds
--------------------------------------- 

This page contains info on how your quiz grades on Gradescope translate into passing grades, or high-pass grades. The following table contains the pertinent information:

| Quiz | Attempt | Max Points | Curve | Pass Score (before curve) | Pass Score (after curve) | High-Pass Score (before curve) | High-Pass Score (after curve) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Module 1 | 1 | 20 | 1 | 15(75%) | 16(80%) | 17(85%) | 18(90%) |
| Module 2 | 1 | 15 | 1 | 11(73%) | 12(80%) | 12.5(83%) | 13.5(90%) |
| Module 3 | 1 | 16 | 1 | 12(75%) | 13(81%) | 13.5(84%) | 14.5(91%) |





<a name="introduction"></a>Regrades
--------------------------------------- 

Regrade requests will be accepted via the *Gradescope regrade tool*. We ask that you adhere to the following guidelines when submitting regrades:

- You should only submit a request if your passing status will change as a result of the request. For example, don't submit a regrade request if your exam is "passed" and getting a few more points will keep your grade as "passed".

- You MUST explain the exact reasoning behind your request. If you just say "I feel like this deserves more points", or "that seems harsh", or "my friend put the same answer down" then we will ignore the request. You need to say "I put the answer X and because of lecture Y that is the correct answer" or "Grading guideline X says 1 point is awarded for statement Y and I say statement Y in my answer when I write ...". In short, you need to **justify** the request.
