\question[3]{
Describe an algorithm that, given a directed graph G represented as an \emph{adjacency matrix}, returns whether or not the graph contains vertex with in-degree $|V| - 1$ and out-degree $0$. In other words, does the graph have a node such that every other node points to it, but it does not point to any other node. Your algorithm must be $O(V)$. Note that there are $\Theta(V^2)$ cells in your adjacency matrix so you'll need to be clever here.

\question[1]{
Write clear pseudo-code to solve the following:\\
\\
given a graph $G$, a start vertex $s$, and a vertex node $t$, use \emph{DFS} to find any path from $s$ to $t$ and return the list of vertices in that path. Your algorithm should stop the search as soon as it finds any path. If $t$ is not reachable from $s$, return an empty path (i.e., an empty list).  The vertices in the list that is returned should be in order from $s$ to $t$. G could be directed or undirected. For this problem, please use an implementation of the search algorithm taught in class and modify it.

\question[3]{
This question is about the \emph{depth-first search tree} and \emph{breadth-first search tree} generated from a given \textbf{connected} graph $G$. Recall that these trees are formed by including the subset edges from $E$ that are traversed to first discover each node in the respective search. With this in mind, prove the following claim:

\emph{If $T_d$ is the depth-first search tree generated by running DFS on $G$ rooted at some node $u$, and $T_b$ is the breadth-first search tree generated by running BFS on $G$ rooted at that same node $u$, then $T_d=T_b \to G=T_d=T_b$. In other words, if BFS and DFS produce the same tree, then the entire graph $G$ was already a tree.}
}

\answer[0.25in]{...}

\question[1]{
 For a given undirected graph $G$, prove that the depth of a DFS tree cannot be smaller than the depth of the BFS tree.  (Clearly state your proof strategy or technique.)

\question[1]{
In the CLRS code for {\em DFS-Visit} at line 8,  we have completed recursively visiting all then un-visited vertices adjacent to vertex $u$, so we change $u$'s color to black.  For this problem, consider what happens if instead we change the color of $u$ to {\em white} at this line.

Explore what this causes to happen by tracing this altered algorithm on a small connected undirected graph.  After you have done that, submit answers to the following questions.

\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\theenumi}{\Alph{enumi}}
\item In no more than a few sentences, clearly describe what the ``DFS'' tree from an initial node $s$ found by this algorithm represents.  (Note:  we put DFS in quotes here because with this change this algorithm is no longer DFS!)
\item Give a mathematical formula (not just an order class) for the number of leaves in this tree for a worst-case input graph.  Describe this worst-case input graph.  (Again, tracing this algorithm on small connected graphs may help you find the answer more quickly.)
\end{enumerate}

}

\question[1]{
The textbook describes two variables that can be associated with each node in a graph $G$ during the execution of \emph{Depth-First Search}: discovery time ($v.d$) and finish time ($v.f$). These are integer values that are unique. Every time a node is discovered (i.e., DFS sees the node for the first time) that node's $v.d$ is set to the next available integer. When DFS is finished exploring ALL of this node's children, $v.f$ is set to the next available integer.

For this question, consider a single edge in a graph $G$ after DFS finishes executing. You might need to reference the textbook or slides for definitions of tree edge, forward edge, back edge, and cross edge. Argue that each edge $e=(u,v)$ is:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A tree edge or forward edge if and only if $u.d < v.d < v.f < u.f$
\item A back edge if and only if $v.d \leq u.d < u.f \leq v.f$
\item A cross edge if and only if $v.d < v.f < u.d < u.f$
\end{enumerate}

You can describe your answers intuitively, but your answers must be clearly articulated.
}



\question[1]{
Given an undirected graph $G$, the {\em eccentricity} of a node $v$ is the largest of the shortest possible distances from $v$ to any other node in the graph. The minimum eccentricity in the graph is called the  {\em graph radius} for $G$. All the nodes in $G$ that have eccentricity equal to the graph radius form a set called the {\em graph center} of G.

Describe (using pseudo-code or a very clea rtext explanation) an efficient algorithm to find the graph center of a graph $G$ and describe its complexity.  (Note: you must make use of algorithms studied in this module, and not  re-invent the wheel.)
