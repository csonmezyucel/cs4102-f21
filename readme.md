<a name="contents"></a>Office Hours Schedule
------------------------------------------

Office hours are held on our **Discord Server** every Sunday-Thursday from 6-10pm. To attend office hours, simply join the office hours queue voice channel and you will be added to the office hours queue. When you are taken off the queue you will be automatically moved to a staging room to wait (it is called oh-up-next). Soon after, a TA will manually pull you off that staging room into their office hours to help you.

Updates to the repository are restricted to approved individuals only, to prevent anybody from messing with the slides right before a lecture.  However, others can still contribute to this repository -- to do so, take the following steps:

1. Create a github account, if you do not have one
2. Fork this repository: you can click on the "Fork" link in the upper right
3. Clone your forked repository on to your local machine
4. Make any changes you want to your forked version, then commit and push your changes back to your forked repository
5. Create a pull request, following the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)

At that point, we will receive a notice that a change has been submitted, and I'll look at it and hopefully accept it into the main repository.

When you want to bring in the updates from the main dsa1 github repository into your forked repository, you will need to follow the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork).
